# Rules

## **How It Works**

> - Each Premier League round, pick **one team** from a single fixture.
> - Your team's match result determines your points.
> - You can only pick the **same team twice per season** — use your picks wisely!

> ### Scoring Basics :material-clipboard-text-outline:

> Your team's match result determines your base points:

| Result | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| Win    | +1    |
| Draw   | 0     |
| Loss   | –1    |

---

### Head-to-Head Matchups :material-head-outline:

If your team plays against a team picked by another player:

> Win +1
> Draw 0
> Loss -1

<!-- | Result | Extra Score |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Win    | +1          |
| Draw   | 0           |
| Loss   | –1          | -->

### Derby Fixtures :material-map-marker-outline:

Picking a team in a derby match comes with added risk and reward:

| Result | Extra Score |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Win    | +1          |
| Draw   | –1          |
| Loss   | –1          |

### Draw Means More Round :material-handshake-outline:

Occasionally, a round will reward drawn matches with extra points:

| Result | Bonus Score |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Draw   | +2          |
| Win    | 0           |
| Loss   | 0           |

### Lonely Pick Bonus

If you're the only player to choose a team, and they win:

| Result | Bonus Score |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Win    | +1          |
| Draw   | 0           |
| Loss   | 0           |

### Double Points Round :material-check-all:

During this round, all points — including bonuses and penalties — are doubled.

### Tiebreaker Rules

If players are tied on points, the total goal difference from all picked teams decides the ranking.

### Missed Picks

If you forget to pick, one is randomly assigned.  
If that team scores positively, you are docked 1 point.  
Negative scores are applied as normal.

## Example Round

> For this example we are going to pretend that this round of games is both a **Double Points** round and also a **Draw Means More** round.  
> In a real game this would be unlikely — however not impossible.

**Results:**

- `Man United 2 ⚔️ 0 Man City`
- `Chelsea 1 - 1 Notts Forest`
- `Arsenal 2 ⚔️ 2 Tottenham`
