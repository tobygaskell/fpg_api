# I Built an Alternative to Fantasy Premier League

Like most groups of lads in their 20s, each year the excitement of a pending Premier League season would mean the arrival of a message on the group chat inviting us all to join another season of FPL.

<!-- more -->

I, however, **dreaded** receiving this message, as it initiated a process I had grown to resent.

---

### Why I Stopped Playing FPL

For those of you who haven't played FPL, before joining a league you have to pick a full team of Premier League players which make up your squad.

If you're anything like me — highly competitive — picking your squad requires you to trawl through **hours of data** and overanalyze every decision:

- Last season’s results
- Recent injury news
- Endless transfer rumours

After **days, if not weeks**, I would finally get my team to a place I was happy with. But more often than not, during the first round, some series of events would reduce all that effort to **nothing**:

- My star striker, who I’d spent hours choosing, gets injured until Christmas.
- My centre-back scores an own goal in the last minute.

This pattern would repeat itself. Over the season I’d become frustrated, then disillusioned. I’d start to **neglect my team**, perform poorly, and — inevitably — finish in the **bottom half** of the league.

Naturally, that meant **friendly abuse from the lads** — which only made it worse, since I _am_ competitive.

---

### The Breakup (And the Return)

Eventually, I decided not to join the league at all. Why play a game I keep losing?

But that turned out to be worse.  
I wasn’t mocked as much, but I also **wasn’t part of the group chat anymore**. I felt left out of 90% of the conversations.  
So after one lonely season, I was back.

---

### There Had to Be a Better Way…

I started wondering: _What if there were a better game?_

One that:

- Didn't become tedious to manage
- Didn’t take up half my mental capacity
- And maybe — just maybe — I wouldn’t be terrible at

---

## Introducing FPG — My Alternative to FPL

FPG was designed with one main goal:

> ✅ It had to be **simple** to play.

Because if I didn’t get many points in a round, I didn’t want to feel like I had wasted hours of my life.

That said, while **user interaction** had to be minimal, the game mechanics had to be **interesting and strategic**.

---

## The Rules of FPG

### 🧾 Basic Rules

Each round of the Premier League, pick **one team**. Based on their match result, you earn:

- **Win** = +1
- **Draw** = 0
- **Loss** = –1

🚫 **You can only pick the same team twice per season.**

---

### 🧠 Extra Rules

#### ⚔️ Head-to-Head

If your team plays against a team picked by someone else in your league:

- **Win** = +1
- **Draw** = 0
- **Loss** = –1

You won’t know who picked what until **after the games are over**.

#### 🔁 Double Points Round

Each round has a 10% chance of being a **Double Points Round**.  
All points (even negative ones!) are **doubled**.

#### 🤝 Draw Means More

Each week also has a 10% chance of being a **Draw Means More** round.  
In these rounds:

- **Draw** = +2
- **Win/Loss** = 0

This means a **draw is the best outcome**, so pick wisely.

#### 🏙️ Derby Game Bonus

If your team is playing in a derby:

- **Win** = +1
- **Loss** = –1
- **Draw** = –1 (because drawing a derby is boring!)

---

### 🏆 How to Win

The winner is the player with the **most points at the end of the season**.

In the event of a tie:  
✅ **Goal difference** across all your picked teams decides the winner.

---

## When Did I Build FPG?

The honest answer?  
I’ve had **numerous attempts** at building it.

The most successful version was completed in **September 2024**.  
But the idea started way back in **2019**.

---

### 📱 My First Attempt — During the Pandemic

I started learning how to build a mobile app during lockdown.

Like many beginner coders, I tried to **run before I could walk**, and the app didn’t get off the ground.

Then I built a **Facebook Messenger chatbot** version of FPG — and it worked!

For about 5 weeks...

Until:

- Facebook flagged my account repeatedly
- The bot started spamming the same messages
- I was locked out

**FPG v1 died.**

---

### 🛑 A 4-Year Pause

That failure led to a long pause. The world reopened. Life got busy.

My brother never let me forget it though. I had promised FPG and never delivered.

I dabbled a few times — I even sent a rules reminder once — but nothing ever stuck.

---

### ⚡ Enter Streamlit

As a **data engineer**, front-end development wasn't my strength.

Then I found [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) — and it clicked.  
I could build an **interactive app** without getting bogged down in CSS or JS.

---

## FPG Today

After another year of tinkering with Streamlit and carving out time…

> ✅ I launched a working version of FPG.

As I write this, **over 30 people** are beta testing it.  
We're planning the **first full season** for **2025/26**.

Thanks for reading — and if FPL has ever driven you mad,  
maybe it's time you tried **FPG**.
